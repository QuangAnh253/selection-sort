## 🔍 About the Project
- Pure **front-end** project (no frameworks, no backend).
- Interactive **visualization** of the Selection Sort algorithm.
- Clean and minimal UI so that anyone can easily understand how the algorithm works step by step.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The array is generated with random numbers.
2. The algorithm iterates through the array to find the minimum element.
3. It swaps the minimum with the first unsorted element.
4. Steps are repeated until the array is sorted.
5. All operations are visualized in real time.
